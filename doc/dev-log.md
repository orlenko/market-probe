### Topic: MarketProbe 2.0 Architecture Planning and Evolution

#### Changes Made:
- Completely restructured dev-plan.md for MarketProbe 2.0 evolution
- Analyzed current codebase structure and identified reusable components
- Planned migration strategy from single-page template to multi-project SaaS platform
- Defined new database schema with PostgreSQL and Prisma ORM
- Outlined comprehensive admin dashboard requirements
- Planned transition from external services (Formspree, Plausible-only) to native solutions

#### Dev Plan Progress:
- Completed comprehensive analysis of existing codebase
- Identified migration paths for existing components (EmailSignup, A/B testing, analytics)
- Restructured development phases to reflect new architecture:
  - Phase 1: Database Foundation (Prisma, Clerk auth, enhanced analytics)
  - Phase 2: API Layer & Native Form Handling (replace Formspree)
  - Phase 3: Multi-Project Landing Pages (dynamic routing, templates)
  - Phase 4: Admin Dashboard (project management, analytics, submissions)
  - Phase 5: Enhanced Testing & Migration
  - Phase 6: Production Deployment with Database

#### New Considerations:
- **Multi-tenancy architecture**: Each project is isolated with own analytics and form submissions
- **Hybrid analytics approach**: Keep Plausible as optional while building first-party analytics storage
- **Custom domain routing**: Support both subpath (`/p/slug`) and custom domain hosting
- **Migration strategy**: Parallel development to maintain existing functionality during transition
- **Database design**: PostgreSQL with JSON columns for flexible project configuration
- **Authentication**: Clerk for admin access (internal use initially)
- **Email notifications**: Native email sending (SendGrid/Mailgun) replacing Formspree
- **Privacy-first analytics**: IP hashing and minimal data collection for GDPR compliance

#### Tools/Commands Run:
- `list_dir` to explore current project structure
- `read_file` to analyze existing components and configuration
- `file_search` and `grep_search` for understanding current implementation
- Dev plan documentation update

#### Next Steps:
- Set up development database with Prisma and PostgreSQL
- Create initial database schema and migrations
- Add Clerk authentication for admin routes
- Begin API layer development for native form handling
- Start migrating existing EmailSignup component to use new APIs
- Create basic admin dashboard structure

#### Architecture Decisions:
- **Database**: PostgreSQL chosen for reliability and JSON support for flexible configurations
- **ORM**: Prisma for type-safe database operations and easy migrations
- **Auth**: Clerk for rapid admin authentication setup
- **Routing**: Next.js App Router for advanced routing capabilities (custom domains)
- **Analytics**: Custom solution inspired by Plausible/Umami for data ownership
- **Deployment**: Continue with Vercel but add database and environment management

#### Migration Risks & Mitigations:
- **Risk**: Breaking existing functionality during refactor
  - **Mitigation**: Parallel development with feature flags
- **Risk**: Data loss during Formspree migration
  - **Mitigation**: Export existing data before migration, gradual rollout
- **Risk**: Performance degradation with database addition
  - **Mitigation**: Query optimization, caching strategies, monitoring setup
- **Risk**: Complex custom domain routing
  - **Mitigation**: Start with subpath routing, add custom domains as advanced feature

- **Created analytics tracking API** (`/api/analytics`) for first-party data collection
- **Built project management APIs** (`/api/projects`) with full CRUD operations
- **Migrated EmailSignup component** from Formspree to native API with enhanced features
- **Added comprehensive validation** using Zod schemas throughout the API layer

- **Multi-project form handling**: Each form submission is tied to a specific project slug
- **Enhanced privacy**: IP hashing, data sanitization, and GDPR-compliant analytics
- **Rate limiting**: Built-in protection against spam and abuse (5 forms/min, 100 analytics/min)
- **Email notifications**: Rich HTML emails sent to admin when forms are submitted
- **Enhanced form capabilities**: Support for name, company, message, and custom fields
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive validation with user-friendly error messages
- **UTM tracking**: Automatic capture and storage of marketing attribution data
- **Honeypot spam protection**: Hidden fields to catch automated bots
- **Transaction safety**: Database operations wrapped in transactions for consistency

- **Scalable API design**: RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP status codes and error handling
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with Zod validation schemas
- **Multi-tenant ready**: Project-based isolation for all data and operations
- **Email automation**: Professional notification system for form submissions
- **Analytics foundation**: Privacy-first data collection ready for dashboard visualization

#### Migration Success:
- **Formspree → Native API**: Complete replacement with enhanced capabilities
- **External analytics dependency reduced**: Now have first-party data alongside optional Plausible
